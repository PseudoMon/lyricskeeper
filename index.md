# PseudoMon's Personal Lyrics Keeper

Personal site by <a href="https://pseudomon.github.io/linktree">PseudoMon</a> to keep track of the lyrics to songs she likes.

I just want a neat simple little site to keep everything, instead of having to wade through, ugh, Fandom Wiki, for some of the more obscure songs.

Made with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) with the Liquid engine, and otherwise the most vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript you can ever see. Yes, including the search thing at the top right. That was a bit of effort huh.
