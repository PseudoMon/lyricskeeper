<h1>Personal Lyrics Keeper</h1>
<p>A personal notebook where I write down lyrics to songs I like.</p>
<p>None of the lyrics here are mine (some of the Japanese songs have translations that are my work, but the original lyrics are not mine). Please don't sue me. If you found your way here, think of it like stumbling on an open notebook in the park.</p>
<p>Made with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> with the Liquid engine, and otherwise the most vanilla HTML/CSS/JS you can ever see. Yes, including the search thing at the top right. That was a bit of effort.</p>
<p>I'm not going to put a license on this project because it contains stuffs that aren't mine, but if you want to use this as inspiration for your own sites (or if you want to yank the JavaScript or CSS files), feel free!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/PseudoMon/lyricskeeper">Here</a> is the site's repo and, in case you're seeing this from the repo, <a href="https://pseudomon.github.io/lyricskeeper/">here</a> is the site itself.</p>
<p>And if you want to know more about me, <a href="https://pseudomon.github.io/linktree">here's where you can find me online</a>!</p>
