<h1>PseudoMon's Personal Lyrics Keeper</h1>
<p>Personal site by <a href="https://pseudomon.github.io/linktree">PseudoMon</a> to keep track of the lyrics to songs she likes.</p>
<p>I just want a neat simple little site to keep everything, instead of having to wade through, ugh, Fandom Wiki, for some of the more obscure songs.</p>
<p>Made with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> with the Liquid engine, and otherwise the most vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript you can ever see. Yes, including the search thing at the top right. That was a bit of effort huh.</p>
