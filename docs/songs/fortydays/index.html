    <h1>Forty Days</h1>
    <h2>By Streetlight Manifesto</h2>

    <p>And it's been forty days
I've tried forty ways
You will never quite leave your sins behind
They'll haunt you, taunt you until the day you die</p>
<p>You will never really go
You'll just think about it much but you'll need to know
how the story ends,
so you'll sit around,
even though you should just go</p>
<p>Tell your friends what you have heard,
show them all the lies unlearned
And when you really go,
you will really know
you were never meant for earth</p>
<p>What's it worth?
If we're going to break it down with any logic, it's absurd</p>
<p>And no matter where we go, we are not alone
When the silence turns to cries of &quot;Why?&quot;
What a way to begin: we inherit sin
And nobody's going to quench your thirst when the well runs dry
And nobody's going to hold your hand on the day you die</p>
<p>I've tasted seven sins,
so they won't let me in
I knock knock knock until my knuckles are bruised and raw
Stuck in the middle with my blood in a puddle on the floor
We made our beds,
we'll judge ourselves
And only then and there
will we disappear
to our final resting place</p>
<p>What a waste!
So many decent people at the gates</p>
<p>And no matter where we go, we are not alone
When the silence turns to cries of &quot;Why?&quot;
What a way to begin: we inherit sin
And nobody's going to quench your thirst when the well runs dry
And nobody's going to hold your hand on the day you die</p>
<p>And no matter who you know, you will be alone
When the silence turns to cries of &quot;Why?&quot;
What a way to begin: we inherit sin
And nobody's going to quench your thirst when the well runs dry, well runs dry
And nobody's going to hold your hand on the day you die</p>
