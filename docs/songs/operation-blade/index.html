      <h1>Operation Blade</h1>
      <h2>By Obadiah Brown-Beach & Xueran Chen</h2>

      <p class="lyrics"><p>I am the one, I'm here, I've infiltrated.
Your time has come to be downgraded.
I've already won as far as I can see,
so keep your eyes on me.</p>
<p>I recommend you keep your distance – I'm combustible.
Keep on burning day and night – I'm unstoppable.
I'm searing hot – I am untouchable!</p>
<p>Yes, I'm on fire!
Ignited by a burning desire!
Can't contain this ember though you try!
Despite all this time you try to stop me, I defy!
There's no bringing me down!
I am the one, I'll be bested by none now!
When all is said and done,
The day is mine!</p>
<p>Oh, like frostbite permeates into your bones,
I'll be the thief that sneaks through, to topple all your thrones.
I'll keep on pushing all night through the storm – I'm insatiable.
Like a unrelenting swarm – insurmountable.
I'll outperform – I'm uncontainable!</p>
<p>Yes, I'm on fire!
Ignited by a burning desire!
Keep on melting holes right through the ice,
And I disintegrate these frozen walls!
I climb so high, there's no keeping me down!
I am the one, I'll be bested by none now!
When all is said and done–</p>
<p>Oh... As winter blows in to freeze it all to grey...
I'll be the heat that melts through to watch it fade away...</p>
<p>I recommend you keep your distance – I'm combustible.
Keep on burning day and night – I'm unstoppable.
I'm searing hot – I am untouchable.</p>
<p>(I am the one, I'm here, I've infiltrated.)
(The time has come to be downgraded.)
(I've already won as far as I can see, so keep your eyes on me!)</p>
<p>Yes, I'm on fire!
Ignited by a burning desire!
Can't contain this ember though you try!
Despite all this time you try to stop me, I defy!
There's no bringing me down!
I am the one, your day of reckoning's come now!
An overwhelming blaze that you can't outrun now!
I've already won, prepare to be overrun!
When all is said and done,</p>
<p>The day is mine!</p>
<p>The day is mine!</p>
<p>I am the one, I'll be bested by none now!
When all is said and done!</p>
