    <h1>Hunter's Song</h1>
    <h2>By Adam Gubman</h2>

    <p>Home
left her homeland miles behind
The hunter she walks
on the seacoast way with her path before her
Crash
and the driftwood floats evermore
It's the salt on my skin
leaving their mark where the walls
once towered</p>
<p>Oh, it's more than a dream;
It's a play, the tides attending.
Oh, our world comes apart at the seams</p>
<p>From the chaos
scared and afraid , I will wander
I will remain , strong but it sets with the sun...
Hopeless I'm chasing the dawn
And I wander, wander on</p>
