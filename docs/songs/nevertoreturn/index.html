    <h1>Never to Return</h1>
    <h2>By Darren Korb</h2>

    <p>By the Scribes, we gather in their names
To face the Nightwings here before the flames
A common foe for all to prove their claim
Prevail for freedom or to fail in shame</p>
<p>Who shall rise again?</p>
<p>The will to overcome shall urge us on
To brave injustice 'til the stars have gone
The favor of the Scribes arrives at dawn</p>
<p>Who shall rise again?</p>
<p>Who lights the way for the aimless?
Favor is for the true Scribe-blessed
Exalted by the flame's ascent
Only the purest heart repents
Repent!</p>
<p>Stars above, below the pyres burn
Who shall remain, whose freedom shall be earned?
To fly this prison never to return
Never to return</p>
