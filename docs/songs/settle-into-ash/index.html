    <h1>Settle Into Ash</h1>
    <h2>By Adam Gubman & Tyler Smith</h2>

    <p>The embers settle into ash
Refuse to bend, to break, look back
It’s all decided in the moment we both choose to fight it
You don’t need armies to take down
The monster underneath the crown
It’s just a one shot, stay locked
Cloak and dagger, what’s you’re after, but
I’m not your hired gun
Bullets to wars, and nothing’s won</p>
<p>This might be your one chance, you can withdraw
I’ll take all your deep cuts, I’ll take it all
I am every mirror, you’re just a wall
Even if I crack, you will watch yourself fall</p>
<p>All talk and never answers.
You spread your hate like cancer
Take your pick either path is reckless,
All talk and never answers
All talk and never answers
All talk and never answers</p>
<p>It’s always consequences
On the fence is not my best, it’s
Hard choice, to stand behind the
One who knows to pull the trigger.
Feeling it all fade fast,
When you mistake broken glass for water.</p>
<p>This might be your one chance, you can withdraw
I’ll take all your deep cuts, I’ll take it all
I am every mirror, you’re just a wall
Even if I crack, you will watch yourself fall
Coming to a hard stop, how does it feel
Knowing no control here, is it surreal?</p>
<p>All talk and never answers
You spread your hate like cancer
Take your pick either path is reckless,
All talk and never answers
All talk and never answers
All talk and never answers</p>
<p>Why does everybody keep talking?
I’m becoming one with the flaws of the war,
Brittle to the bone
My marrow is filled with caution,
It’s often
They lie to us just to make a profit.
Everybody lost it,
That’s why I’m making paths of my own.
The king falls then his men call for the throne
While the people that keep everybody breathing is grieving
So why should we attack?
It all falls back
Been down to fight
But what happens when the screen goes black</p>
<p>I call upon the elements,
The weapons on my back
While I run upon the sediment.
No matter who comes in the way,
You know I’ll settle it.
From armies to the mercenaries to the kings and queens or myself</p>
<p>Just because I’m level headed doesn’t mean I don’t need help
So get up get up
Everybody need to move
Just get up get up
Everybody need to move
Fight for a cause, and it
Don’t matter if you lose so</p>
<p>This might be your one chance, you can withdraw
I’ll take all your deep cuts, I’ll take it all
I am every mirror, you’re just a wall
Even if I crack, you will watch yourself fall
Coming to a hard stop, how does it feel
Knowing no control here, is it surreal?</p>
<p>All talk and never answers
You spread your hate like cancer
Take your pick either path is reckless,
All talk and never answers
All talk and never answers
All talk and never answers</p>
<p>Get up get up everybody
Just get up get up everybody need to move</p>
