    <h1>The Roar of the Spark</h1>
    <h2>By Daisuke Ishiwatari & NAOKI</h2>

    <p>Through the darkest sky
Groping for the light
Like crying for the moon</p>
<p>Never-ending black
Forgot what I want
Never felt that hard to me</p>
<p>That's right, go forth
Don't look back
I can believe in the path I'm on
Faith, pride
So, what do I have to fear?</p>
<p>Under the sacred briars
Never stop, just go
I don't care how many more scars I get
Bearing the pale fire
I'm going as far as I can
I hope my path will be
A guide of light for someone to follow
The roar of the spark</p>
<p>The dawn that burns my eyes
What a strange scent
Sound that comes flooding in</p>
<p>Never-ending white
Forgot what I want
Is this Arcadia?</p>
<p>I don't know what's right for the world
Oh, I may have lost my way
But there's no reason to doubt it now
So, what do I have to fear?</p>
<p>Under the sacred briars
Never stop, just go
I don't care how many more scars I get
Bearing the pale fire
I'm going as far I can
I hope my path will be
A guide of light for someone to follow
The roar of the spark</p>
<p>Dive the deep blue sea
It is hard to breathe
The light goes out again</p>
<p>Never-ending road
A place without color
That's the world we can dye</p>
<p>That's right, go
Don't look back
I can believe in the path I'm on
Faith (faith), pride (pride)
So, what do I have to fear?</p>
<p>Under the lonely moon
In an influx of words
This road shines with my colors
Bearing the pale fire
I'm going as far as I can
To keep the glow alive</p>
<p>Under the sacred briars
Never stop, just go
I don't care how many more scars I get
Bearing the pale fire
I'm going as far as I can
It will be endless
And it's not an easy journey
Hoping to fill the world
With all kinds of light</p>
