    <h1>Ensheath</h1>
    <h2>By David Lin & Robert Wolf & Obadiah Brown-Beach</h2>

    <p>All you would show to working men
is your crooked crescent lips.
Their limbs and their throats just hang by threads,
wrapped around your fingertips.</p>
<p>I raise my sword as a shield.
Harden my soul into steel.
Yes, my sword may shatter
and explode like daggers,
but off of me they'll ricochet
right back at you like pouring rain.</p>
<p>Oh, you trap a thousand nameless pawns
without cages, without chains.
The ones who we lost from your wars we fought
were all puppets in your game.</p>
<p>Ah...
(I raise my sword.)
(Harden my soul.)
Ah...
(I raise my sword.)</p>
<p>I raise my sword as a shield.
Harden my soul into steel.
Yes, my sword may shatter
and explode like daggers,
but off of me they'll ricochet
right back at you like pouring rain.</p>
<p>From the iron fists for life
is a burden we can't lift.
I once had the fight of a radiant knight
before I learned that justice may never exist.</p>
<p>Is it all for naught?
Is there use for fighting on?</p>
<p>I raise my sword as a shield.
Harden my soul into steel.
Yes, my sword may shatter
and explode like daggers,
but off of me they'll ricochet
right back at you like pouring rain.</p>
