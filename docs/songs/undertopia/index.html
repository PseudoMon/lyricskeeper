      <h1>Undertopia</h1>
      <h2>By Adam Gubman & Moonlist</h2>

      <p class="lyrics"><p>Through the thunder, on the wind.
Baby wolf all in a spin
to run, run, run away from here.
Run, run, run away from here.
And you fight back through the rain.
A struggle, hide the pain.
Run, run, run, you're pushing through.
Run, run, run away from you.
Softness is fields of surrender
under the stars, through the hills, over walls.</p>
<p>Little pup, your head is in the sand.
Your pads are strong, you stand
clawing through, your chains are broken
free is where your confidence is crowned.
A queen of hills, renowned.
Nothing here can
keep your heart
in a tiny cage.</p>
<p>A place she's never been,
where it's safe to start again.
Run, run, run, it's not so far.
Run, run, run from where we are.
It's a promise, cross the moors,
hunting what you know is yours.
Run, run, run, it's yours to make.
Run, run, run, it's yours to break.</p>
<p>Strength is the nothing you left there.
Carry the sun on your back, start again.</p>
<p>Little pup, your head is in the sand.
Your pads are strong, you stand
clawing through, your chains are broken
free is where your confidence is crowned.
A queen of hills, renowned.
Nothing here can
keep your heart
in a tiny cage.</p>
<p>If this was forever,
you'd sever the tether.
We'd cherish the wilds and explore
from forest to ocean.
Our plan is in motion,
becoming who we really are.</p>
<p>We rule through broken hearts.</p>
<p>Little pup, your head is in the sand.
Your pads are strong, you stand
clawing through, your chains are broken
free is where your confidence is crowned.
A queen of hills, renowned.
Nothing here can
keep your heart
in a tiny cage.</p>
