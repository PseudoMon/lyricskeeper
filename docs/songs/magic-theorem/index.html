    <h1>Magic Theorem</h1>
    <h2>By Adam Gubman & Sarah Kang</h2>

    <p>When the sun fades out of sight,
constellations come to life,
the serotonin keeps us floating,
we contemplate our lives.
To the numbers, safe and sound,
my hypotheses abound.
I've got a theory,
you're there with me,
transcending data found.</p>
<p>Take a picture, don't forget her.
Let it linger in your view.
The formula for finding magic:
One plus one, just me and you.</p>
<p>Falling for a simple dream,
a theorem of a fantasy I
live fully.</p>
<p>If patterns prove us right,
more than particles and light,
it's (a) simple science,
full compliance,
it keeps me up at night.</p>
<p>Take a picture, don't forget her.
Let it linger in your view.
The formula for finding magic:
One plus one, just me and you.</p>
<p>Falling for a simple dream,
a theorem of a fantasy I—
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la.
—live fully.</p>
<p>Life is a gift to me, I'm here for it.
Like a smile at a party, I swoon,
measure time by the moon.
Is it over too soon?</p>
<p>Take a picture, don't forget her.
Let it linger in your view.
The formula for finding magic:
One plus one, just me and you.
[×2]</p>
<p>Falling for a simple dream,
a theorem of a fantasy I—
La-la-la-la-la, la-la. [×2]</p>
