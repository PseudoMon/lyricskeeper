I am the one, a lost boat in the ocean
trying to find a shore, to breathe, to begin.
Moonlight fills the emptiness in the night.
Only see those waves, echoing in the tide.

Stand on the broken deck,
listen to the loneliness,
feel the stormy rain start to breed,
Let it come, let it come, let it come.

Then there's the light
came from the deepest darkest storm in the sea.
The rain is pouring, the ocean's crumbling,
you're the only thing I can see.

Then there's the light
came from the deepest darkest storm in my heart.
Break through the night,
so strong and bright,
you are my lighthouse.

I am the one, a lost boat in the ocean.
(In the ocean.)
Only Heaven knows the blue of the sea.
(Blue of the sea.)
Moonlight fills the emptiness in the night.
Only see those waves echoing in the tide.

Stand on the broken deck,
listen to the loneliness.
The stormy rain starts to breed,
let it come, let it come, let it come.

Then there's the light
came from the deepest darkest storm in the sea.
The rain is pouring, the ocean's crumbling,
you're the only thing I can see.
Then there's the light
came from the deepest darkest storm in my heart.
Break through the night,
so strong and bright,
you are my lighthouse.

You are my lighthouse.
