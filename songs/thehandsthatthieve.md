I felt no guilt 'til I was caught
And I was told that I was guilty
And even then I wasn't really sure, yeah yeah
That the thing I felt was guilt itself
Or maybe it was something else
Frustration at the fact that I was ever caught at all

I told a lie that multiplied
By the time I realized it
I'd given up everything I ever loved, yeah yeah
'Cause the thing you lack
When you're looking back
Is the pressure, the feel that you have to act
Yeah everything is clearer when
You're looking at the past, oh no

And I don't care if I lose
Because my heroes did too
They shouted court should be adjourned
Because the jury are fools
And the judge can't decipher his left from his right
Or his right from his wrong

And I will bite the hand that thieves
I will not turn the other cheek
This is no threat
It is a promise I will keep
So what's the point pretending
When we've seen behind the curtain
And there's nothing much to see
Oh yeah

I felt no pain 'til I was down
And I was told that I was bleeding
And even then I knew I wasn't done, yeah yeah
The scars I get
They will just collect
Insuring that I won't forget
Reminders of the battles
That I've lost and that I've won

And I will fight until I have died
Or all my enemies are allies
And even then I will sleep with an open eye, yeah yeah
'Cause the night is long and our foes are strong
And I know the road we travel on
It always seems so dark because we've almost reached the dawn
Oh no

And I don't care if I lose
Because my heroes did too
They shouted court should be adjourned
Because the jury are fools
And the judge can't decipher his left from his right
Or his right from his wrong
And I will bite the hand that thieves
I will not turn the other cheek
This is no threat
It is a promise I will keep
So what's the point pretending
When we've seen behind the curtain
And there's nothing much to see
Oh yeah

And everyone will claim
That they knew from the beginning
Exactly how it'd end
But they still just went on sinning

The sudden rush you feel
When realizing everything you know will fade away
It holds you dear but you don't wanna let it go
Someday we'll lose the war
But 'til then we will dream of winning

I won't forget
The things you said
When I was down and I was tired of it
The words you spoke
They brought me 
Hope

When it was time to fight
I chose a side
But I knew in my heart that something didn't feel right
So I stood my ground
And waited for a sign

And I sang

Oh, I don't care if I lose
Because my heroes did too
They shouted court should be adjourned
Because the jury are fools
And the judge can't decipher his left from his right
Or his right from his wrong
And I will bite the hand that thieves
I will not turn the other cheek
This is no threat
It is a promise I will keep
So what's the point pretending
When we've seen behind the curtain
And there's nothing much to see
