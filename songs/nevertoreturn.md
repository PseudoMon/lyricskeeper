By the Scribes, we gather in their names
To face the Nightwings here before the flames
A common foe for all to prove their claim
Prevail for freedom or to fail in shame

Who shall rise again?

The will to overcome shall urge us on
To brave injustice 'til the stars have gone
The favor of the Scribes arrives at dawn

Who shall rise again?

Who lights the way for the aimless?
Favor is for the true Scribe-blessed
Exalted by the flame's ascent
Only the purest heart repents
Repent!

Stars above, below the pyres burn
Who shall remain, whose freedom shall be earned?
To fly this prison never to return
Never to return
