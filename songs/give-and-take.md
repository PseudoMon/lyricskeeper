They're comin' for us now
(Coming for us now)
Somehow they found us out
(They found us out)
No sudden moves, don't make a sound
They're out for blood this time around
We gotta burn it all down

Today's the day
Revolution's on its way
(Our time is now)
Hold the line
This is how we'll be defined
(Just stand your ground)
Give and take only works when both sides really give and take
The revolution's on its way

(Look around, what do you know?)
This whole damn place is about to blow
(Look around, what do you see?)
I see the wolves at bay comin' after me
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, get ready for the war
They're comin' now, yeah they're right outside the door

They tried to hold us down
(Tried to hold us down)
But they can't control us now
(Can't control us oooh)

Today's the day
Revolution's on its way
(Our time is now)
Hold the line
This is how we'll be defined
(Just stand your ground)
Give and take only works when both sides really give and take
The revolution's on its way

(Look around, what do you know?)
This whole damn place is about to blow
(Look around, what do you see?)
I see the wolves at bay comin' after me
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, get ready for the war
They're comin' now, yeah they're right outside the door

(Door)
Break us down more
They want it all!
(They want it all)
They're gonna try to take us all
They wanna see us fall
Get ready for the war!

(Look around, what do you know?)
This whole damn place is about to blow
(Look around, what do you see?)
I see the wolves at bay comin' after me
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, get ready for the war
They're comin' now, yeah they're right outside the door

(Look around, what do you know?)
This whole damn place is about to blow
(Look around, what do you see?)
I see the wolves at bay comin' after me
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, get ready for the war
(They're comin' now, yeah they're right outside the door)
They're comin' now, yeah they're right outside the door
