I am the one, I'm here, I've infiltrated.
Your time has come to be downgraded.
I've already won as far as I can see,
so keep your eyes on me.

I recommend you keep your distance – I'm combustible.
Keep on burning day and night – I'm unstoppable.
I'm searing hot – I am untouchable!

Yes, I'm on fire!
Ignited by a burning desire!
Can't contain this ember though you try!
Despite all this time you try to stop me, I defy!
There's no bringing me down!
I am the one, I'll be bested by none now!
When all is said and done,
The day is mine!

Oh, like frostbite permeates into your bones,
I'll be the thief that sneaks through, to topple all your thrones.
I'll keep on pushing all night through the storm – I'm insatiable.
Like a unrelenting swarm – insurmountable.
I'll outperform – I'm uncontainable!

Yes, I'm on fire!
Ignited by a burning desire!
Keep on melting holes right through the ice,
And I disintegrate these frozen walls!
I climb so high, there's no keeping me down!
I am the one, I'll be bested by none now!
When all is said and done–

Oh... As winter blows in to freeze it all to grey...
I'll be the heat that melts through to watch it fade away...

I recommend you keep your distance – I'm combustible.
Keep on burning day and night – I'm unstoppable.
I'm searing hot – I am untouchable.

(I am the one, I'm here, I've infiltrated.)
(The time has come to be downgraded.)
(I've already won as far as I can see, so keep your eyes on me!)

Yes, I'm on fire!
Ignited by a burning desire!
Can't contain this ember though you try!
Despite all this time you try to stop me, I defy!
There's no bringing me down!
I am the one, your day of reckoning's come now!
An overwhelming blaze that you can't outrun now!
I've already won, prepare to be overrun!
When all is said and done,

The day is mine!

The day is mine!

I am the one, I'll be bested by none now!
When all is said and done!
