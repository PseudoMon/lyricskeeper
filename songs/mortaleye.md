Stop the fire
A mockingbird sings
My name, laughing, calling me
Who’s the liar?
Maybe you’re in my bones, my blood
Take it all
Filling me up, I’m empty
Heartbeats
Counting down, if I could stop the clock, you’d win

So whisper the names of your enemies

There’s a darker cloud
Than what you left inside
Growing like the winter wind
I can bear your weight
Your words and selfish pride
You will not escape this sin
This is my revenge
I’ll take us to the end
You can watch beneath my skin
Fear is just a smokescreen, heat is still my friend
I will use the burn to win

Whispering
Falling into a sleepwalk
Pacing carefully
I don’t dream
Closing each chapter without pain
Silent watch
There was a time I had a family, everything
Frozen halt
Oh, my numb epiphany

So whisper the names of your enemies

There’s a darker cloud
Than what you left inside
Growing like the winter wind
I can bear your weight
Your words and selfish pride
You will not escape this sin
This is my revenge
I’ll take us to the end
You can watch beneath my skin
Fear is just a smokescreen, heat is still my friend
I will use the burn to win

This shell, a castle
These walls will not be scaled

You’re captured
It’s sick, how things have turned
And all the lessons learned

Whisper the names of your enemies

Whisper the names of your enemies

I’m not your enemy

There’s a darker cloud
Than what you left inside
Growing like the winter wind
I can bear your weight
Your words and selfish pride
You will not escape this sin
This is my revenge
I’ll take us to the end
You can watch beneath my skin
Fear is just a smokescreen, heat is still my friend
I will use the burn to win
