Setting fire,
fire to the night.
All of my old ways
scattered in the sky,
floating higher
and gone before my eyes.
But I'm staying steady.
Oh, I've been ready.
Yeah, I've been praying
for the rain.

Let it all start again.
I could never lose hope in you.
I'm praying for the strength,
oh, to carry the weight.
Tell me, can you feel it too?

Don't wanna do this alone.
I can feel it deep in my bones.
I can feel the ground start to shake.
I'm rising from the...

Ashes!
Ashes!
Ashes...
Coming through the flames,
I'm calling out your name!
I'm calling out your name!

From the...
Ashes!
Ashes!
Ashes...
Coming through the flames,
I'm calling out your name!
I'm calling our your name!
From the ashes.

Inside the damage,
can you show me I can trust you?
Cause all of the old ways are buried in the dust.
But don't you panic,
we'll always find a way out.
I would never let you down.

So tell me, will you rise up, tell me, will you stay?
When you feel the pressure underneath the weight,
oh, the weight...
I'm rising from the...

Ashes!
Ashes!
Ashes...
Coming through the flames,
I'm calling out your name! 
I'm calling out your name!
[×2]
From the ashes.
From the ashes.
From the ashes.
From the ashes.

Ashes!
Ashes!
Ashes...
Coming through the flames,
I'm calling out your name!
I'm calling out your name!
[×2]
From the ashes.
